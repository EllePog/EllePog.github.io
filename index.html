        <p>I was born November 2001 in Illinois. I moved up here after I just turned 8. I was in small private Christian Schools until I finished 6th grade and the school shut down and I moved into public school. I graduated Kimberly High School in 2020. I went to UW Whitewater to become a Spanish teacher until I decided that I didn't want to be in a classroom the rest of my life. Took a year and a half off to work at Home Depot and decided to go into the coding world. I went to UW Greenbay for one semester when I found out I had cancer. I finished out and then took some time for treatments and such. I am almost two years in remission. Then I came here for IT and Software Development. Life is going great right now and I am excited for this class.</p>
